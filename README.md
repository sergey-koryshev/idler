The application helps you to track your work activity. It stores the activity in local file `Microsoft Access Database` in its folder by default.

## Pre-requirements

You need to have the following components installed in your system before start the application:

- [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
- [Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54920)

## Basics

### DataBase file

When you launch the program in first time, it creates new DataBase file in its folder. The file has format `Microsoft Access Database` so you can open it with `Microsoft Access` and make some manual changes or you can create some queries or whatever you need and it will be kept in the file and won't be removed by the `Idler`. You can moved the file in place you need and specify new path in settings.

### Notes

Note represents a single activity. It contains follow properties:

- Category
- Effort
- Description

List of note categories can be managed in Settings window.

You can add new note by controls located at the bottom of the main window. Once you finish to fill all fields just hit `Enter` or press button `+` and the note will be added to a selected date. To select another day you have a few options:

- click on calendar icon and select desired date from appeared popup
- type desired date manually in date input and press enter or change focus
- press buttons `<` and `>` to decrement/increment selected day by one

When you decrement/increment days using corresponding buttons you probably want to skip weekends since they are not supposed to store work notes. You can enable skipping weekends feature in `Settings` and they will be skipped then. Note, in this case you are still able to get a weekend as selected date via another options. And if any weekend has at least one note, it won't be skipped in this case.

When you added notes you want, don't forget to press button `Save Changes` (Ctrl+S) to save all notes to DataBase file. All unsaved notes are marked by the following icons:

- `pen icon` - category, effort or description was changed
- `opposing arrows icon` - only order was changed
- `new document icon` - note was created

To refresh list notes for selected date you can press button `Refresh`, note that if you confirm to refresh list with unsaved changes they will be discharged.

To remove note, click on red cross button which appears when mouse cursor is over a note.

To change note's order, you can drag it by draggable area at the left of the note and drop it in desired place withing the note list.

### Status Bar

- `Background Tasks button` - shows the list of background tasks are running currently
- `Total Effort counter` - shows total effort for all notes for selected date including value from area to add new note
- `Spelling Errors counter` - shows amount of spelling errors across all notes for selected date
- `Lock icon` - blurs/unblurs notes for selected date
- `Bell icon` - enables/disables reminder notifications

### Spellcheck

All input elements related to note's description or category's name can have spellcheck feature enabled. You can turn it on in Settings.

When the feature is enabled, you will be able to see spellings errors in fields mentioned above. Note, that the errors is always shown in area to add new note or category while the errors in particular note's description or category's name is shown only when you have focus in the field. To identify right field where spelling errors are found, `underscored ab letters` icon appears at the right within the field. Additionally total count of spelling errors found in notes of selected day is displayed in status bar.

Language which is used to perform spellcheck is current input language on your PC, and when you change it, the application automatically refreshes results of checking for new input language.
